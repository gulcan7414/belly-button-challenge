Belly Button Biodiversity dataset which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

1. First create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.Following steps:

* Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.
* Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.
* Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.

2. After Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.Following steps:

* Use otu_ids for the x values.
* Use sample_values for the y values.
* Use sample_values for the marker size.
* Use otu_ids for the marker colors.
* Use otu_labels for the text values.

3. Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.
